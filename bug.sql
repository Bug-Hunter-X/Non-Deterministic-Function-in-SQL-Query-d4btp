The SQL query uses a function that is not deterministic, but the query is used in a context that requires a deterministic function. This can lead to unpredictable results, especially when the query is used in a context where the function is called multiple times with the same input.  For example, using RAND() in a WHERE clause can produce different results each time the query is executed.

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE employee_id = RAND();
```
